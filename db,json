At rest, data is encrypted using AWS for databases and Cloudflare for object storage. Both AWS and Cloudflare use AES256 for disk encryption. Our IT infrastructure is 100% cloud-based.\n2. Is the sensitive data in transit encrypted? Please elaborate the specifics. All customer data is transferred securely using TLS v1.2 and above from the iPad app and Envoy dashboard to the cloud. All requests are routed through Cloudflare which acts as a firewall.\n3. What are the data types that are retained by the hosted service for legal and business reasons and what is the retention period? Envoy stores your data indefinitely while you’re a customer. We only delete or purge data upon explicit request. Customer data is available for download as a CSV file through the dashboard or via our API. Data can be anonymized, which removes all personally identifiable information from your Visitor Log, upon request. Envoy may retain customer data for up to 30 days after termination of the contract.\n4.
